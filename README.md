A collection of MATLAB scripts, toolboxes, and my own work that I've found
useful. To install in linux, run the configure script:

./configure.bash

To install in Windows, open matlab preferences, and navigate to Path options.
Choose "Add with subfolders", and add the 'toolbox' folder to your path.
