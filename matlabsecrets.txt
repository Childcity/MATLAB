This is a list of little tricks and helpful hint's I've picked up.  Right now it's just a scratch pad, but eventually it will be roganized properly, maybe even a latex project.


Animation functions

1) Make it so that the user has a way to cancel the animation neatly.  One issue with overloading the CloseRequestFcn is that if the program throws an error, that function is thrown out of memory.  The below way simply aborts the loop if the handle is no longer valid.

while
	h=renderFrame()
	if ~ishandle(h)
        break;
    end
end

2) Use refreshdata if possible, rather than clearing and recreating the plot from scratch.  The renderFrame function should take an optional handle as an argument.  If it's not passed in, it should initialize a plot window (or if it's not valid).  If it is, use the set function to update the data in the plot ('XData', etc.)
